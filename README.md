- 👋 Hi, I’m @naivar68
- 👀 I’m interested in Python and Go programming, and am finally starting to branch out to github to showcase some of my learning projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and will be starting my studies in Go within the next month.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on subjects relating to cyber security, and general AI.  I find these topics fascinating and fun to work with, and experiment.
- 📫 How to reach me is simple - email me at naivar@pm.me
